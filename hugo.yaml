      I am a software developer with a passion for game development. I have a background in Unity, Java, Roblox Lua and Game Design. I really do have too many game ideas and already have a wall full of post-it's because of that. 
      Currently I am finishing my computer science Bachelor at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz and i am searching for a part time job as Game Developer, to work next to my master study in computer science!
      Probably I am the total nerd who is running their own server with own personal applications.
